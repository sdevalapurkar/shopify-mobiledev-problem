# Store Magnifico
An iOS and Android (cross-platform) mobile application built using React Native to solve the Shopify Mobile Development problem.

You're a successful Shopify merchant! You've been busy promoting your store, and in the whirlwind of marketing, dealing with suppliers, and shipping ordersâ€”you've completely forgotten to run some reports on your latest orders. Create a mobile app that calculates and displays the following data:
The amount (in Canadian dollars) spent by Napoleon Batz, one of your favourite customers!
The number of Awesome Bronze Bags that have sold (total quantity)

Retrieves data from a Shopify API for orders and calculates values of amount spent by customers and amount of items sold.
